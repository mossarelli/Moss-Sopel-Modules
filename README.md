# Moss-Sopel-Modules

## Description
Corrected and custom modules for the Python IRC bot called Sopel.

## From the creator:
Just fork or give a direct line of what needs to be changed in files.
 
## Installation
Put the modules files from the repo into the Sopel's module folder. There are two different folders one can use.
First one is in: /home/user/.sopel/modules
Second one is in: /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/sopel/modules

Editing the modules in the second folder is not recommended as these are updated or changed as part of the Sopel distribution. Updating Sopel may overwrite these files and thus ruin your changes.

## Usage
Use /query on your bot and write: .reload
After reloading the modules, try the module you made or edited.

## Contributing
Contributions are not expected.
